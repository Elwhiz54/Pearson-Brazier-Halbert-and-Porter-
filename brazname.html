&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The english surname Brazier is occupationnal in origin, 
being one of those surnames based on the type of work a man once did or the
 profession he once pursued. In this instance, the surname is 
derived from the old English word "brasian", meaning "to make of
 brass", and as such would indicate that the original bearer of 
the surname was a brass founder by trade in the medieval ages.
 Occasionally, it originates from Old English "Broesian" which
 means "to cast in brass" this is an occupational name for "A 
worker in brass", particularly in smelting and pouring of moulton
 brass onto sand to form a Brass Sheet.<br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be remembered that before the advent of the hereditary 
system of surnames, it was not unusual to name a person according 
to the type of work that he was associated with as it provided a 
simple form of identification and distinguished the bearer from
 others in the community. References to this medieval occupation 
date back to the Middle Ages and mention of the occupation is recorded
 in Cocke Lorrelle's Bote which dates back to the sixteenth century 
when he says "Pavyers, bell-makers, and brasyers ". Early references 
to the surname date back as far as the thirteenth century and are 
substantiated by numerous medieval sources. Some a these early
 instances include Henry le Brazur who was mentioned in the 
"Hundred Rolls" for Huntingdonshire in 1273 an also William 
Brasier who is recorded in the "Subsidy Rolls" for Essex in 1327. 
The "London Commercial and Court Directory" recorded seven instances 
of the surname in 1870. William Brazier, a labourer, aged nineteen, 
sailed from London to virginia on the ship 'Elisabeth" as an indented
 servant in November, 1774, and is evidence of the early existence of 
the surname in America.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brazier surname, is also derived from the name Brashears and is a 
patronymic version of the English occupational name Brasher, which
 was brought to England by the Normans during the Conquest. Brasher 
is derived from Old French "brasser" which means "to brew." A French
 cognate is LeBrasseur.
